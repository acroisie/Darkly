# Explanation
This exploit, known as a "Brute Force Attack," involves systematically checking all possible passwords until the correct one is found. It is a straightforward yet time-consuming approach that relies on trial and error. For this specific case, the attack was focused on the SignIn page (`http://x.x.x.x/?page=signin`) of a web application. Commonly used passwords, often found in publicly available lists, were utilized in the script to attempt login with username as `admin`. By iterating through a list of the top 25 most used passwords, the script attempts to gain unauthorized access to the system.

# How to Prevent This
Brute force attacks exploit the number of attempts made: the more attempts, the higher the chances of success. To mitigate such attacks, limit the number of login attempts within a certain time frame. Implementing account lockout policies or progressively delaying response time after failed attempts can be effective. Additionally, enforcing complex passwords significantly increases the number of attempts required, reducing the feasibility of brute force attacks. It's essential to balance security measures with user convenience to ensure a secure yet user-friendly system.
