# Explanation
This exploit, identified as "HTTP Header Spoofing," involves modifying HTTP request headers to bypass security checks and gain unauthorized access. It was discovered by examining the main page's source code, where hidden instructions in HTML comments hinted at the requirements for accessing a restricted page. The instructions suggested altering the `Referer` and `User-Agent` headers. The server expects a `Referer` header indicating the request originated from "https://www.nsa.gov/" and a custom `User-Agent` named "ft_bornToSec." To simulate these conditions and access the restricted content, a `curl` command can be used:

```bash
curl -e "https://www.nsa.gov/" -A "ft_bornToSec" "http://192.168.1.15/?page=b7e44c7a40c5f80139f0a50f3650fb2bd8d00b0d24667c4c2ca32c88e13b758f" | grep flag
```

This command sets the required `Referer` and `User-Agent` headers, potentially revealing sensitive information or a flag upon successful execution.

# How to Prevent This
Relying solely on `Referer` and `User-Agent` headers for security is inadequate, as these can be easily spoofed. To enhance security, implementing additional verification methods, such as multi-factor authentication, is advisable. This approach requires users to provide multiple forms of identification, significantly reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access through simple header manipulation.
