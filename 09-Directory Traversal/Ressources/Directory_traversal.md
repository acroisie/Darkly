# Explanation
The "Directory Traversal" exploit involves manipulating web application URLs to access unauthorized files. By altering the URL parameter (`page`), users can navigate the server's directory structure. An example is accessing the Unix system file `/etc/passwd` via a URL like `http://x.x.x.x/?page=../../../../../../../etc/passwd`. This exploit is often successful due to insufficient validation of user inputs that influence file paths.

# How to Prevent This
To prevent Directory Traversal:
- Validate and sanitize user inputs that affect file paths.
- Use secure file serving methods that do not expose direct filesystem paths.
- Restrict server file permissions and implement server-side directory access checks.

This exploit aligns with the "Guess (hidden file)" item from your initial exploit list. It capitalizes on guessing or discovering files typically hidden from web users.
