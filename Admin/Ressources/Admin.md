# Explanation
Upon inspecting the site's `robots.txt`, a `/whatever` link was discovered, leading to a file containing an MD5 encrypted password. By decrypting this password and combining it with the corresponding ID, access to the `/admin` page was achieved, revealing the flag. It's essential to securely encrypt sensitive data like passwords and restrict access to administrative areas of websites.

# How to Prevent This
To prevent unauthorized access, avoid listing sensitive paths in `robots.txt` and ensure robust encryption methods are in place for passwords. Implementing multi-factor authentication and limiting exposure of administrative URLs enhances security against unauthorized access and data breaches.
